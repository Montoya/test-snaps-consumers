# test-snaps-consumers

A collection of simple, zero-dependency dapps that connect to the snaps in <a href="https://github.com/MetaMask/test-snaps">@metamask/test-snaps</a> and call their methods to demonstrate how snaps are used across dapps.

If you want to run this on your local machine, you can use python 3's http.server to serve the folder with `python -m http.server 3001` (or change 3001 to whichever port you want to use).
